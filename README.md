# VBA-Challenge
This workbook was created to run a stock market analysis that highlights the yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year for each ticker, calculated in points and percentages. From there we see the total stock volume of each ticker. Lastly, we can see which stock had the greatest increase, decrease, and total volume. This analysis will help us recognize trends, and how stocks are performing during specific markets and give us some insight into economic patterns. 

The script should run on each worksheet for a seamless and efficient analysis at all times. 

This script was developed with my study group of Katy, Michelle, Joan, and Elizabeth, and David H. from Stack Overflow.
