# VBA-Challenge
This workbook was created to run a stock market analysis that highlights the yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year for each ticker, calculated in points and percentages. From there we see the total stock volume of each ticker. Lastly, we can see which stock had the greatest increase, decrease and total volume. This anaylsis will help us recongize trends, how stocks are peforming during certian markets and give us some insight to economical patterns. 

The script should run on each worksheet for a seamless and efficent analysis at all times. 

This script was developed with myself and study group consisting of Katy, Michelle, Joan and Elizabeth, and David H. from Stack Overflow.
